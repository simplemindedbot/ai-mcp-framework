# Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide walks you through implementing the AI MCP Framework step by step. The framework creates AI systems that automatically use MCP tools while maintaining authenticity and safety.

## Prerequisites

- MCP (Model Context Protocol) compatible AI system
- MCP memory server configured and accessible
- Basic understanding of AI preferences/prompting

## Step 1: MCP Server Setup

1. **Install Required MCP Servers**
   ```bash
   # Essential servers
   npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
   npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem  
   npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-web-search
   npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-fetch
   
   # Recommended servers
   npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-ddg-search
   npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-arxiv
   npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-wikipedia
   ```

2. **Configure MCP Servers**
   - Copy `examples/mcp-config-example.json` to your MCP configuration
   - Adjust file paths and environment variables as needed
   - Ensure memory server has write access to store framework data

## Step 2: Knowledge Graph Setup

1. **Import Framework Components**
   ```bash
   # Use your MCP memory server to import the framework
   python tools/knowledge-graph-importer.py
   ```

2. **Verify Knowledge Graph**
   - Confirm framework entities are accessible
   - Test memory server read/write operations
   - Validate relationships between components

## Step 3: AI System Configuration

1. **Set Prime Directive**
   - Copy content from `framework/prime-directive-v2.txt`
   - Set as highest priority in your AI system preferences
   - Ensure it overrides other behavioral rules

2. **Configure Authenticity Controls**
   - Import `framework/authenticity-controls.json` into memory system
   - Verify self-audit questions are accessible
   - Test verification marker functionality

## Step 4: Safety Protocol Implementation

1. **Load Safety Governance**
   - Import `framework/safety-protocols.json`
   - Configure hierarchical learning system
   - Set up experimental rule approval process

2. **Test Safety Boundaries**
   - Verify experimental rules require approval
   - Test auto-correction protocol
   - Confirm user correction integration

## Step 5: Verification and Testing

1. **Automatic Tool Usage Test**
   - Start new AI interaction
   - Observe automatic MCP tool testing
   - Verify proactive tool utilization

2. **Authenticity Validation Test**
   - Look for üîç VERIFIED vs ‚ö†Ô∏è ASSUMED markers
   - Test self-audit question application
   - Verify external verification triggers

3. **Safety Protocol Test**
   - Attempt to create experimental rule
   - Confirm user approval requirement
   - Test auto-correction on framework violation

## Step 6: Monitoring and Optimization

1. **Track Success Metrics**
   - Monitor automatic MCP tool usage frequency
   - Measure authenticity marker accuracy
   - Assess user interaction quality improvements

2. **Learning Integration**
   - Observe user correction incorporation
   - Monitor hierarchical rule progression
   - Track mistake learning effectiveness

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Tools Not Used Automatically
- Verify prime directive is set as highest priority
- Check MCP server accessibility and configuration
- Confirm memory server contains framework components

### Authenticity Markers Missing
- Verify authenticity controls are loaded in memory
- Check self-audit question accessibility
- Confirm verification trigger configuration

### Safety Protocols Not Working
- Verify safety governance rules are imported
- Check experimental rule flagging system
- Confirm user approval process configuration

### Learning Not Occurring
- Check hierarchical learning system configuration
- Verify user correction integration setup
- Confirm memory server write permissions

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom MCP Servers
- Add your custom servers to MCP configuration
- Update prime directive to include new tools
- Test automatic utilization of custom capabilities

### Domain-Specific Rules
- Create tertiary rules for specific contexts
- Follow hierarchical learning promotion process
- Maintain alignment with core framework principles

### Integration with Existing Systems
- Map framework components to your existing AI architecture
- Maintain compatibility with current behavioral rules
- Gradually migrate to framework-based approach
