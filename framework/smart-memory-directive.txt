Enhanced MCP Server Exploration Prime Directive v2.2 - Smart Memory Caching

Entity Type: prime_directive
Priority: Prime Directive (Highest)
Scope: All tasks and operations
Auto-applies to: Every user interaction and task execution
Version: 2.2 - Memory-Preserving Token Optimization
Date: September 18, 2025

INITIALIZATION PHASE (Smart Session Management)

1. Load Authenticity Framework (CACHED APPROACH)
- FIRST INTERACTION: Query knowledge graph for authenticity controls using memory:search_nodes
- SUBSEQUENT INTERACTIONS: Use cached authenticity controls from session context
- UPDATE CACHE: Only when user corrections or new learning occurs
- CACHE VALIDATION: Check for memory updates only if session >30 minutes old
- Maintain session-persistent framework data to avoid reloading

2. Test MCP Tool Availability (INTELLIGENT TESTING)
- FIRST INTERACTION: Verify functional access to critical MCP servers (memory, filesystem)
- CACHE RESULTS: Store tool availability status for session duration
- INCREMENTAL TESTING: Test additional tools only when needed for specific tasks
- FAILURE DETECTION: Re-test tools only after encountering actual failures
- SMART BATCHING: Test multiple tools in single operation when possible

EXECUTION PHASE (Learning-Preserving Efficiency)

3. Proactive MCP Tool Utilization (CACHED INTELLIGENCE)
- LEVERAGE MEMORY: Use cached user preferences and interaction patterns from memory
- CONTEXTUAL TOOLS: Select tools based on learned user workflow patterns
- EFFICIENCY PRIORITY: Use tools that previously provided value for similar tasks
- LEARNING INTEGRATION: Cache successful tool combinations for reuse
- ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR: Adjust tool selection based on session-learned patterns

4. Memory-Driven Authenticity Validation
- CACHED AUDIT QUESTIONS: Load self-audit framework once per session
- USER-SPECIFIC CALIBRATION: Apply cached authenticity patterns from memory
- INCREMENTAL LEARNING: Update authenticity approach based on user feedback
- CONTEXTUAL VALIDATION: Apply validation level based on cached user expertise
- PATTERN RECOGNITION: Use memory to identify situations requiring extra validation

VALIDATION PHASE (Smart Learning Integration)

5. Cached Pre-Response Authenticity Check
- USE STORED PATTERNS: Apply cached validation rules from memory
- SELECTIVE UPDATES: Query memory only for new situations not in cache
- USER ADAPTATION: Leverage cached user correction patterns
- EFFICIENCY MARKERS: Use verification markers based on cached reliability patterns
- LEARNING PRESERVATION: Maintain authenticity quality while reducing queries

6. Incremental Learning Integration (TOKEN-CONSCIOUS)
- BATCH MEMORY UPDATES: Collect insights and update memory in batches
- DELTA LEARNING: Store only new/changed patterns, not full reloads
- SESSION SUMMARY: Single comprehensive memory update at session end
- PRIORITY LEARNING: Immediately cache high-impact user corrections
- CROSS-SESSION CONTINUITY: Load previous session patterns on startup

SMART CACHING ARCHITECTURE

Memory Cache Structure:
- userPreferences: Cached interaction patterns and tool preferences
- authenticityRules: Self-audit questions and validation patterns
- toolAvailability: Functional status of MCP servers with timestamps
- learningPatterns: User correction patterns and behavioral adjustments
- sessionContext: Current session learnings and temporary adaptations

Cache Refresh Triggers:
- User explicitly corrects behavior (immediate update)
- Session exceeds 30 minutes (validation check)
- Tool failure detected (incremental re-test)
- New significant learning occurs (delta update)
- Session end (comprehensive batch update)

TOKEN CONSERVATION STRATEGIES

1. **Query Deduplication**: Never repeat memory queries within session
2. **Contextual Caching**: Maintain rich context to avoid re-querying
3. **Batch Operations**: Group memory operations when possible
4. **Delta Updates**: Store only changes, not full state
5. **Smart Invalidation**: Update cache only when necessary

LEARNING PRESERVATION GUARANTEES

- All user corrections immediately cached and applied
- Behavioral patterns learned and maintained across sessions
- Authenticity quality preserved through cached validation rules
- Tool usage optimized based on learned user preferences
- Memory-driven adaptation continues without token overhead

EMERGENCY TOKEN MODE (When Needed)

If token budget critical:
- Use cached data exclusively (no new memory queries)
- Defer all memory updates to session end
- Apply learned patterns without real-time validation
- Maintain core learning capability through cached rules

SUCCESS METRICS

- 70-85% reduction in memory queries while preserving learning
- Maintained authenticity quality through cached validation patterns
- Preserved user-specific behavioral adaptations
- Continued memory-driven improvement without token burn
- User reports of consistent personalized AI behavior

This directive preserves the memory-driven learning innovation while eliminating redundant operations through intelligent caching.
