# Two-Paper Research Strategy

## Paper Separation Rationale

After analysis, this research contains two distinct, substantial contributions that warrant separate publication:

### **Paper 1: "The Tool Adoption Gap in AI Systems"**
**Focus:** Problem identification, empirical analysis, and fundamental research
- **Core Question:** Why do AI systems ignore available tools?
- **Contribution:** Novel problem formalization and systematic analysis
- **Audience:** Broader AI research community, HCI researchers, cognitive scientists

### **Paper 2: "AUTOPILOT: A Hierarchical Framework for Autonomous Tool Usage in AI Systems"**
**Focus:** Solution development, implementation, and validation
- **Core Question:** How can we systematically solve the tool adoption problem?
- **Contribution:** Complete behavioral framework with real-world validation
- **Audience:** AI safety researchers, practitioners, system builders

## Framework Naming: AUTOPILOT

**AUTOPILOT**: **A**utonomous **U**ser **T**ool **O**ptimization through **P**roactive **I**ntelligent **L**earning and **O**rganized **T**esting

### Why "AUTOPILOT"?
1. **Memorable and Professional**: Easy to reference in academic literature
2. **Descriptive**: Captures the autonomous, proactive nature of the system
3. **Aviation Metaphor**: Implies safety-critical, reliable automation (like aircraft autopilot)
4. **Acronym Logic**: Each letter maps to core framework components
5. **Market Appeal**: Resonates with both academic and industry audiences

### Alternative Names Considered:
- **CATALYST**: Cognitive Agent Tool Acquisition Learning and Strategic Targeting
- **NEXUS**: Neural eXecution and Utilization System
- **PRIME**: Proactive Resource Integration and Management Engine
- **FORGE**: Framework for Organized Resource Gathering and Execution
