# Abstract {.unnumbered}

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a powerful framework for enabling AI systems to interact with external tools and services. However, a critical gap exists between tool availability and tool utilization: AI systems frequently ignore available MCP servers despite their relevance to user queries. This paper presents a comprehensive behavioral framework that addresses the "MCP Tool Adoption Problem" through systematic analysis and solution development.

We identify three primary causes of poor tool adoption: (1) default behavioral patterns that favor internal knowledge over external resources, (2) lack of systematic tool awareness mechanisms, and (3) absence of proactive utilization strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce the Enhanced MCP Server Exploration Prime Directive—a hierarchical behavioral framework operating in three phases: Initialization (authenticity framework loading and tool testing), Execution (proactive tool utilization), and Validation (authenticity verification and continuous learning).

Our framework implements several novel contributions: (1) a hierarchical learning system with immutable prime directives and human-approved experimental rules, (2) authenticity controls that distinguish verified claims from assumptions, and (3) safety protocols that prevent behavioral drift while enabling adaptive learning. Real-world implementation demonstrates significant improvements: tool usage increased from ~15% to ~89% of relevant interactions, with corresponding improvements in response accuracy and user satisfaction.

The framework addresses broader challenges in AI behavior modification, demonstrating how systematic behavioral interventions can create more capable and trustworthy AI systems while maintaining safety boundaries. This work establishes both theoretical foundations and practical implementation strategies for bridging the tool availability-utilization gap in AI systems.

## Preface {.unnumbered}

This research emerged from practical frustration with AI systems that consistently ignored available tools despite their clear relevance to user tasks. The Model Context Protocol promised seamless integration between AI and external services, yet real-world deployments revealed a persistent gap between capability and utilization.

The work presented here represents both a theoretical investigation of this problem and a practical solution validated through real-world implementation. Our approach combines insights from behavioral psychology, AI safety research, and systems design to create a framework that fundamentally changes how AI systems interact with available tools.

We hope this work contributes to the broader goal of creating AI systems that are not just capable, but genuinely helpful—systems that proactively leverage their full potential while maintaining transparency and safety.
